#  Loan Approval Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project automates loan approval decisions using machine learning based on applicant data. This project aims to develop a model that predicts whether a loan should be approved or rejected based on historical applicant data. By automating this process, banks can improve efficiency, reduce processing time, and enhance the fairness and reliability of loan approvals.


##  Problem Statement
Manual loan approval processes are slow, inconsistent, and prone to error. In traditional banking systems, the loan approval process is often manual, time-consuming, and subject to human bias or inconsistency. Loan officers must evaluate multiple factors such as income, credit score, employment history, and past defaults — a task that can be prone to errors and delays, especially when handling large volumes of applications. As financial institutions increasingly adopt digital systems, there is a strong demand for intelligent, data-driven tools that can assist in making accurate and consistent loan decisions. This project creates an ML model to automate these decisions and improve accuracy and speed.
